# My first MVC ( simple blog with AUTH)

-Implemented most MVC principles except making a class for validation (Which I implemented to ensure the entered data is correct) but didn't make a class as I said.

-other than that, everything works perfectly, from routers to controllers to rendering variables and errors.

The Database has two tables

  -Users
    -id
    -username
    -password
    -roles (not implemented)
  
  -Posts
    -id
    -title
    -text
    -writer
    -last_edited (user ID)
